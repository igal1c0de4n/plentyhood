          Have you ever wondered why we buy and hold onto the same tools,
          books and other things &ndash; yet most of the time not use them? 
          Seen a tree in your neighborhood dropping all its fruit, 
          while no one enjoys it?
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Plentyhood</strong> assists with sharing local resources,
          by mapping them in a clear and accessible way for you and your friends.
          </p>
          <p>
          Families, friends, and neighbors can cooperate together: make 
          better use of garden produce, fruit trees, tools. Offer assistance 
          and services. All local, mapped and easy to access!

                There are many ways we benefit from globalization but let's face it &ndash; 
                our community is shattered. 
                Global economy took over in an attempt to replace our community 
                but it's lacking the human touch, and isolates people. 
                The interaction, the smiles, the handshakes, 
                the feeling we're working together. 
                Some of us believe that getting back in touch with the 
                people around us is fun and can bind us. 
                We want you to experience it, so we built this app to prove it.
                If you choose to explore Plentyhood, 
                we thank you for giving us the opportunity. 
                We hope to bring collaboration and fun into your life, 
                and to give you a chance to be a part of a stronger, 
                self-sufficient community!
