          Have you ever wondered why we buy and hold onto the same tools,
          books and other stuff -- yet most of the time not use them? 
          Seen a tree in your neighborhood dropping all its fruit, 
          while no one enjoys it?
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Plentyhood</strong> assists with sharing local resources,
          by mapping them in a clear and accessible way for you and your friends.
          </p>
          <p>
          Families, friends, and neighbors can cooperate together: make 
          better use of garden produce, fruit trees, tools. Offer assistance 
          and services. All local, mapped and easy to access!
