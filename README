Plentyhood
==========

This web application is all about cooperation within the local community.
It's about sharing resources such as tools, gardens, services etc. 
Creating the next-gen 'Craigslist', on a whole new level, the app wroks with 
the user's location and provides results which are closer and thus more relevant.
At first, the app focuses on gardening: helping people growing food, not lawns.
After that, well, the sky is the limit! =)
