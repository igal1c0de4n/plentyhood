Plentyhood
==========
Plentyhood is a web application builds on the recent sharing revolution to facilitate sharing and cooperation within a local community. It's about sharing resources such as tools, produce, gardens, services and more.

The app wroks with the user's location to enable access to resources which are closer and thus more relevant. Search for resources is tag-based
